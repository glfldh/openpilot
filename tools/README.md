# openpilot tools

## System Requirements



openpilot needs git, a compiler, Python 3, .
Our setup script should work on all mainstream Linux distros and macOS (Apple Silicon).

Most of openpilot should work natively on macOS. On Windows you can use WSL for a nearly native Ubuntu experience. Running natively on any other system is not currently recommended and will likely require modifications.

## Native setup on Linux and macOS

Follow these instructions for a fully managed setup experience. If you'd like to manage the dependencies yourself, just read the setup scripts in this directory.

**1. Clone openpilot**
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/commaai/openpilot.git
```

**2. Run the setup script**
``` bash
cd openpilot
tools/op.sh setup
```

**3. Activate a Python shell**
Activate a shell with the Python dependencies installed:
``` bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**4. Build openpilot**
``` bash
scons -u
```

## WSL on Windows

[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) should provide a similar experience to native Linux. [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions) specifically has been reported by several users to be a seamless experience.

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to setup the WSL and install the `Ubuntu-24.04` distribution. Once your Ubuntu WSL environment is setup, follow the Linux setup instructions to finish setting up your environment. See [these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps) for running GUI apps.
